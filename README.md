# gameformykids

I was always curious about how 3D games work and how are they created. To combine my curiosity with my kids' possible 
future interest in games, I decided to create a simple game for them.

In the game a player (kid) will be able to choose any animal as a player. This animal will follow
path on the terrain that will be full with obstacles. The player must jump above the obstacles to continue the path 
all the way to the finish.

## Progress tracking 

I also decided to track the progress of features that I implement inside "progressScreenshots" directory. For anyone 
curious about the progress, you can check the screenshots there. For those who are interested in the code and 3D game
features, you can check the related commit that is attached with uploaded screenshot.
